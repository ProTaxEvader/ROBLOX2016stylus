**To install the latest release click [here](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/raw/downloads/.user.css-installFiles/release.user.css).** \
**Find a bug? See if it has been fixed in the [latest prerelease](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/raw/main/devDownloads/roblox2016-preLatest.user.css).**
## Dark Theme
Dark theme is now supported as of the unreleased version and soon to be released userscript version [1.2.8](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/devDownloads/roblox2016-preLatest.user.css). \
Dark theme support will not be 100% faithful to the 2016 era of Roblox.
Please report any bugs related to dark theme.


If you don't have it already, this requires Stylus to function. Get it at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) or at [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). \

## helloUser.user.js
This userscript brings back the [Hello, User](https://files.catbox.moe/26eosn.png) thing that used to be at the top of the site.\
[helloUser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/main/helloUser.user.js)[.js](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) is a userscript. It was built on [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) so I'd recommend using that. I haven't tested it out on other extensions like [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).

### Display Compatability
Your display/monitor needs to be at least 1024 pixels wide for this style to work correctly. \
**Note: I don't know what other people or I did, but thinner displays should work fine in any releases past 1.2.0.x.* \
I'd recommend at least a 1366 x 768 monitor or, even better, a 1920 x 1080 monitor.
## Releases<1.2.5
For myself. \
After, I think, merging a clone of this repo into itself through git prior releases to 1.2.5 dissapeared. \
Access the older releases by manually accessing certain tags. ```https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/releases/tag/{release<1.2.5}``` \
[1.0.4](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/releases/tag/1.0.4), [1.2.0](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/releases/tag/1.2.0)
